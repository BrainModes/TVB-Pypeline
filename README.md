# TVB-Pypeline
Work in Progress!

At the moment this pipeline simply tries so resemble our other, shell-script based, pipeline at http://github.com/BrainModes/TVB-empirical-data-pipeline

The sripts are all included in the notebooks folder, currently as ipython notebooks and py-files.

TVB_pipeline is the "master-control-script" which is later intended to be run via the console
(i.e. python TVB_pipeline.py )
